The Experiment of Perturbation Methods
==
<br>Write the code to implement the perturbation methods based on “geometric data transform” and “noise addition”<br/>
<br>Then, run any machine learning model (e.g. SVM) on the perturbed data, and observe how the perturbation impacts on
the machine learning system<br/>
<br>Finally, provide the results Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC<br/>
