The Experiment of K anonymity
==
<br>Use Mondrian method to implement the privacy preserving method based on  K anonymity algorithm<br/>
<br>Then, run some machine learning models (e.g. SVM) on the above result data <br/>
<br>Effectiveness measure: Misclassification Error, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and AUC<br/>
<br>Privacy level: the value of K=10<br/>
<br>Dataset: Adult<br/>
